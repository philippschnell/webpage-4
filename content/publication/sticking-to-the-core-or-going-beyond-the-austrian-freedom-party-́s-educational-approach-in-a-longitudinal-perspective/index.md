abstract: Although populist radical right parties (PRRPs) are actively studied
  in recent years, few research has addressed their approach to education
  policy. Previously not considered one of their signature issues, this paper
  argues that education has become important for PRRPs too. In a case study of
  the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ), one of the most longstanding and successful
  PRRPs in Western Europe, we explore key pillars of the FPÖ's educational
  positions and their development over time. Drawing on qualitative content
  analysis of party programs, election manifestos and plenary debates from 1990
  to 2020, our analysis shows that the policy area of education has indeed
  become an ideological battleground for the FPÖ. Its educational positions are
  largely grounded in the ideological core of PRRPs and comprise a fundamental
  critique of mainstream parties’ dominance in educational institutions
  (anti-mainstream); a nativist division on all levels of education (nativism);
  the advocacy of merit-based educational institutions coupled with
  authoritarian instruments of schooling (merit); and a plea for more
  liberalisation and competition in schools (liberalisation). Over time,
  positions become more nuanced, albeit only within the already established
  traits. These findings corroborate theoretical arguments for the influence of
  growing party age and government experience on PRRPs’ positions.
